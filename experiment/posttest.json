      "question": "A Maxwell’s inductive bridge shown in figure below is used to measure an unknown inductance in comparison with known inductance. The values at balance R<sub>2</sub>= 590Ω, R<sub>4</sub>=60Ω, R<sub>3</sub>= 100Ω, r<sub>2</sub>=10Ω and L<sub>2</sub>= 2mH. Calculate the values of R<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> . Calculate also the Q-factor of the coil if frequency is 1000Hz.<br/><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"image/quiz2.jpg\" style=\"width:460px;height:320px\"></p> ",
